As mentioned in the [previous article](%PREVIOUS_ARTICLE%), organizational psychology knows a great deal about processes with negative impact on trust, cooperation and collaboration.

This article is devoted to the practices and approaches which turn teams into groups by hurting interdependence, cooperation and trust.

## Focus on individual performance and competition

Dr. W. Edwards Deming called focus on individual performance one of the seven deadly diseases:

> Evaluation of performance, merit rating, or annual review… The idea of a merit rating is alluring. the sound of the words captivates the imagination: pay for what you get; get what you pay for; motivate people to do their best, for their own good. The effect is exactly the opposite of what the words promise.

The reason for such a harsh description was that focusing on individual performance introduces competition between members of the group, which, as stated in the [previous article](%PREVIOUS_ARTICLE%), is detrimental to cooperation and therefore teamwork.

Imagine a hunting team aiming to kill a mammoth: what are the chances the team could succeed if the individuals were competing instead of cooperation?

Individually distributed bonuses make the situation even worse. The calculation of individual bonuses is based on determining the individual contribution to the common result, which is only possible in a group setting (remember the hunting group?). It is not possible to calculate individual contribution in a team setting where the common result is a _synergistic_ product of collaborative efforts of interdependent actors (the hunting team). In the hunting team, any individual’s input is interwoven with the inputs of others and is amplified or diminished by these interactions. There’s no way to _measure_ how much hunter 1 helped hunter 2 realize his plan, or how quickly hunter 3 noticed the mammoth needed more distraction since hunter 4 was just about to attack.

As soon as individual input is measured, the interactions are neglected. When bonuses are granted for “individual performance”, they work as social appreciation for the efforts for which the bonus is granted. Humans are social animals; we are motivated by social appreciation. The motivation brought by bonuses is short-term and deteriorates quickly, and it inevitably changes our behavior to achieve exactly what the bonuses are granted for. When the hunter is granted a bonus for, say, the number of spear strikes delivered to the mammoth, his main motivation becomes to deliver as many strikes as possible, at the expense of helping his teammate. Hence, the interactions are neglected, interdependence and trust weaken, the team deteriorates to a mere group, and the emergent quality of a super-result disappears. It is much harder to maintain a team in the presence of individual bonuses.

Additionally, interactions can’t be reduced to actions. When the distraction specialist in the team is set with a KPI of the number of times he jumped and waved his hands, he will be focused on achieving that number instead of interacting with the attacking specialists to achieve the common goal through cooperation. Even the commonality of the goal is diminished by the mere presence of individual KPIs.

Some companies also practice [gamification](%GAMIFICATION%), which is also detrimental to cooperation since it fosters individual competition.

With regards to trust, KPIs are also detrimental. Trust by definition means that the reciprocity is only _expected_ by the trustor: there's no way for the attacking hunter to sign a contract with the distracting specialist with all the types of actions he expects. The attacking hunter simply presumes they both cooperate and that the distracting hunter can be _trusted_ to act in the best interests of the team.

A manager providing individual employees with KPIs shows their distrust in employees. Employees seeing they aren't trusted, will play along, and the team will reduce to a mere group of individuals.

In social sciences, the effects of KPIs and other reductionist interventions are well-described in the [Law Of Unintended Consequences](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/UnintendedConsequences.html).




## Interventions and micromanagement

- regular 1-1s %1-1S%

trust is diminished by:
- time trackers, imposed deadlines, hyper-control (micromanagement)


micromanagement https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26241568/

> some managers will respond to complexity by increasing levels of control over team members and workplace practices (Chuang, Kendra, & Craft, 2011). Managers with such controlling behaviors are sometimes known as micromanagers, especially when the control they wield over staff is preoccupied with the minutiae or minor details of day-to-day workplace operations (White, 2010)


The manager is the driver of the coordination, which reduces internal team coordination and cooperation:
- The manager assigns tasks to individuals, plans the workload and the workflow between the individuals (the boss is the head, the group is the body executing orders), manager defines the processes for the team to work
- Manager providing individual feedback during regular 1-1s influences the individuals instead of the team doing that themselves, or manager helping the whole team to find a way to resolve issues within the team themselves
- In the extreme form — micromanagement

### Efforts coordination done by the manager

Trust is fundamentally based on autonomy, as [research indicates](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30034987) that controlling behavior is interpreted as a lack of trust and an infringement on individual autonomy.

Professionalism necessitates autonomy, but not in an unstructured manner that permits anything to be done. Rather, it involves working within the provided constraints of the market, professional knowledge and ethics to deliver high-value outcomes for clients.

The era of simplistic, mechanistic Taylor-style reductionist management has long since passed, and imposing decisions on the process of work is a clear indicator of an attempt to control and a lack of trust.



## Lack of reciprocity



When the manager promises something and the employee trusts them, but then the manager doesn’t fulfill the promise, there’s a lack of reciprocity or a breach of trust. The trust is gained slowly and destroyed easily by:
- Layoffs
- Promising certain work conditions (or a promotion) and not keeping the promise

## Process activities or cultural peculiarities promoting negative or conflictual social dynamics.

- Activities like PR-based code-reviews, which force people to judge the work of each other and pinpoint “the mistakes”
- Departmental silos with incentives on reductionist work results: if a QA engineer is in a separate department from the developer, and is incentivized to find more bugs, then they aren’t going to form a team with the developer.
- HR having KPIs on bringing more candidates to the interview process will have hard times focusing on the company goal rather than their individual one.


## 1. KPIs, OKRs and performance reviews

Each of these practices involves establishing quantifiable and measurable objectives for employees as a form of control.

When predefined metrics are put in place to assess performance, there is no trust in the employee's ability to achieve the desired outcomes without the control.

As [the Tyranny of Metrics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K458MZG) book says:

> When metrics are used by managers as a tool to control professionals, it often creates a tension between the managers who seek to measure and reward performance, and the ethos of the professionals (doctors, nurses, policemen, teachers, professors, etc.). The professional ethos is based on mastery of a body of specialized knowledge acquired through an extended process of education and training; autonomy and control over work; an identification with one’s professional group and a sense of responsibility toward colleagues; a high valuation of intrinsic rewards; and a commitment to the interests of clients above considerations of cost.

The inherent lack of trust induced by the pre-set control triggers Control Aversion effect. [Studies prove](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30034987) that control costs generate an overall negative effect, introducing the feeling that the employee is _not trusted_. When a manager sets a minimum performance requirement before the employee chooses a productive activity, the employee delivers less.

## 2. Layoffs

Layoffs in most cases are [not economically justified](https://www.careerusa.org/resources/career-files/158-resources/career-files/16-must-read-articles/372-lay-off-the-layoffs.html), [negatively affects laid off employees health](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11199253/) (sometimes even [provoking suicide](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0004867414521502)), [negatively affects managers health](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.20102), [significantly decrease performance of remaining employees](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/174038/1/dp11128.pdf).

It is evident that layoffs are generally perceived as unjust and erode trust in the employer. Such actions exploit the vulnerability of the employee, instilling fear among those who remain.

[Current research on trust and distrust in organizational settings](https://www.jstor.org/stable/259288) identifies fear as one of the primary indicators of the highest degree of distrust:
