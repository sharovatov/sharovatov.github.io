Job descriptions often list “multitasking” as a beneficial or even must-have skill. But is multitasking really a plus?

[Research shows](https://www.apa.org/topics/research/multitasking) that simply switching between tasks can cost as much as 40% of someone’s time. And all that task and context switching can lead to mental overload, which increases the risk of mistakes.

If you’re job hunting and see a job that demands candidates be great multitaskers — think twice about applying. The company likely lacks understanding of work psychology, which could be an early warning sign of unreasonable and inefficient work expectations.
