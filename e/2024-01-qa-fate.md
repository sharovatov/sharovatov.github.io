## QA fate

Ask any QA specialist, and they will tell you hundreds of stories of how they uncover bugs everywhere, not just in the products they help develop, but in all spheres of life. It's a common sentiment among QA engineers: the world is full of bugs. But is this a case of the [availability heuristic](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/availability-heuristic) and QA folks just believe they witness and participate in more bugs, glitches and defects than others? The availability heuristic is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method, or decision. Testers, due to their professional focus on finding bugs, might recall instances of bugs more readily, making them seem more frequent or prominent than they actually are.

Or could it be QA's [occupational psychosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_psychosis) or [déformation professionnelle](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275544234_The_Structure_of_Professional_Deformation), where their professional habits lead to subconsciously seek out negative or edge case scenarios?

Here's a recent incident that made me think about all this. I was planning a simple bus journey from Berlin to Paris. The process was straightforward: visit an aggregator website, select a bus, and purchase the ticket. Soon enough, I had my e-ticket in hand.

[E-TICKET]

But something caught my eye – the carrier was named "Virtual Carrier European intercity bus". 'Virtual' seemed odd, prompting me to dig deeper. A quick search led me to the [distribusion API documentation](https://api.distribusion.com/doc/demo_environment), revealing:

> For API testing and carrier onboarding purposes, Distribusion provides a dedicated demo environment, accessible through unique credentials. The demo environment provides full access to production schedules and meta data for marketing carriers and stations.
>
> For general testing purposes, Distribusion has introduced the notion of virtual carriers, which simulate the different carrier types available on the platform and for which the full search, booking, ticketing, and cancellation / amendment flow can be conducted coherently in the demo environment.

I realized I had inadvertently booked a ticket for a non-existent bus, courtesy of a test environment showing up on a live site. More intriguing was that the payment system, fully functional and separate from the booking system, failed to recognize the test ticket and charged my card the real money for the test ticket.

As I realised that the payment system didn't distinguish between the test ticket and the live ticket, I happily understood I didn't lose the money — all I had to do is to go and cancel the ticket. the cancellation was successful, and the payment system successfully initiated the refund.

In a way, I had become an unwitting, unpaid QA consultant. But it left me wondering: How often do we, as QA professionals, find ourselves inadvertently testing the world around us?
