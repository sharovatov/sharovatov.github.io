A response to [Bas Dijkstra post on automation tools](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7135888937180348416/).

I believe that any automation should be a step taken only after we've perfected and thoroughly understood our manual process.

If we rush to automate a manual process that is not yet mastered, how can we ensure the automation itself is effective?

I understand the allure of third-party tools which promise to simplify our manual processes. However, we must be cautious. These tools often come with a significant caveat â€“ the challenge of information asymmetry. We understand our context and processes, but can the same be said for these external solutions? 

This situation harks back to George Akerlof's "Market for Lemons" about the risks in quality uncertainty. Trust in the vendor becomes paramount when direct verification of a tool's suitability is complex. Do we trust the vendors?
