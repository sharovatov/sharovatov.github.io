<p>On engineers, managers and decision making</p>
<p>Engineers often blame managers for making irrational or suboptimal
decisions, labeling them as inept, often in jest. Yet, these managers
aren’t born overnight; many were once engineers. This begs the question:
Do we engineers consistently make sound decisions before transitioning
into managerial roles?</p>
<p>I remember presenting a talk on Process Decision Records (PDR). The
concept was straightforward:</p>
<p>1️⃣ Before implementing any solution, technical or process-related,
ensure a thorough understanding of the problem. Ascertain that your
proposed solution truly addresses the issue, is optimal, and that its
side effects or costs don’t outweigh the problem.</p>
<p>2️⃣ Be aware that the optimality of a solution can change over time.
It might become irrelevant or even detrimental, necessitating its
revision or replacement. Regular reassessment is therefore crucial.</p>
<p>How many engineers follow this simple procedure and can genuinely
justify (first to themselves) the reason for implementing a specific
approach or technology in their development process?</p>
<p>Is it realistic to expect that engineers, who blindly follow “best
practices” in their work, will behave differently when they become
managers?</p>
<p>Can we expect engineers, who don’t do the engineering work properly,
to change their approach when they become managers themselves?</p>
<p>Does our social existence determine our consciousness, or is there
room for our consciousness to shape our social existence?</p>
