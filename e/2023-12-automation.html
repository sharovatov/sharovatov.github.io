<p>A response to <a

Dijkstra post on automation tools</a>.</p>
<p>I believe that any automation should be a step taken only after we’ve
perfected and thoroughly understood our manual process.</p>
<p>If we rush to automate a manual process that is not yet mastered, how
can we ensure the automation itself is effective?</p>
<p>I understand the allure of third-party tools which promise to
simplify our manual processes. However, we must be cautious. These tools
often come with a significant caveat – the challenge of information
asymmetry. We understand our context and processes, but can the same be
said for these external solutions?</p>
<p>This situation harks back to George Akerlof’s “Market for Lemons”
about the risks in quality uncertainty. Trust in the vendor becomes
paramount when direct verification of a tool’s suitability is complex.
Do we trust the vendors?</p>
