On engineers, managers and decision making

Engineers often blame managers for making irrational or suboptimal decisions, labeling them as inept, often in jest. Yet, these managers aren’t born overnight; many were once engineers. This begs the question: Do we engineers consistently make sound decisions before transitioning into managerial roles?

I remember presenting a talk on Process Decision Records (PDR). The concept was straightforward:

1️⃣ Before implementing any solution, technical or process-related, ensure a thorough understanding of the problem. Ascertain that your proposed solution truly addresses the issue, is optimal, and that its side effects or costs don't outweigh the problem.

2️⃣ Be aware that the optimality of a solution can change over time. It might become irrelevant or even detrimental, necessitating its revision or replacement. Regular reassessment is therefore crucial.

How many engineers follow this simple procedure and can genuinely justify (first to themselves) the reason for implementing a specific approach or technology in their development process?

Is it realistic to expect that engineers, who blindly follow "best practices" in their work, will behave differently when they become managers?

Can we expect engineers, who don't do the engineering work properly, to change their approach when they become managers themselves?

Does our social existence determine our consciousness, or is there room for our consciousness to shape our social existence?
