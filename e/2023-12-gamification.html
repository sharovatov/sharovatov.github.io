<h2 id="on-gamification">On gamification</h2>
<p>In many companies I see a rather disturbing pattern: engineers are
incentivized with some internal “points” or “currency” for published
articles or other “public” activity, then these points can be exchanged
for items like merch or additional PTOs. Sometimes those who contributed
the most are celebrated as “top contributors” on some leaderboard.</p>
<p>This approach is usually referred to as “gamification”.</p>
<p>Games are profoundly influential in human development and learning.
Esteemed theorists like Huizinga even believed #1 that our entire lives
are structured around play – a sentiment echoed by many from Vygotsky #2
to Berne #3, and Elkonin #4 to Gross #5, whose ideas influenced the
Montessori #6 approach.</p>
<p>However, gamification differs from traditional games. It involves
applying game-like elements to non-game settings #7. My perspective is
that while gamification is effective, its effect is not necessarily
positive. Its effectiveness stems from our innate understanding and
comfort with game mechanics, leading to easy engagement.</p>
<p>But gamification comes with several clear drawbacks:</p>
<p>1️⃣ The overjustification effect #8 – this occurs when external
rewards decrease a person’s internal motivation. In essence, giving
someone an external incentive erodes their intrinsic drive over time.
“Incentives work, and that’s the problem” #9. This is problematic as
features like leaderboards can motivate people to do more, but not
necessarily in a healthy or sustainable way. Deming would also argue #10
that a system should be designed to promote teamwork and collective
success rather than individual accolades, in order to achieve optimal
organizational performance and quality.</p>
<p>2️⃣ Stress #11 – Introducing competition in a workspace inherently
brings additional stress. This is particularly detrimental in fields
requiring intellectual labor.</p>
<p>3️⃣ Diminished autonomy and diversity – Gamification tends to push
individuals towards predefined activities, framing their behavior within
narrow confines. This can stifle creativity and discourage exploration
of new methods or ideas. For example, a gamified system might reward
writing articles over innovative audience engagement methods.</p>
<p>The most significant issue with gamification is its focus on
individual or team competition, which can undermine a collaborative
spirit. It raises the question of how altruism and teamwork can thrive
in an environment where individuals or teams are pitted against each
other.</p>
<p>In a corporate context aiming for collective customer benefit,
internal competition seems out of place #12. Instead, the focus should
be on competing against external challenges, uniting as a strong,
synergistic group.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe gamification is often used as a band-aid
solution to address deeper internal issues. If employees are reluctant
to engage in tasks like article writing, it could be due to a lack of
skills, fear, or insufficient time and motivation. Implementing
gamification in such situations might appear beneficial but can
ultimately be more harmful.</p>
