This article focus on the negative social dynamics triggered by various aspects of organizational design, process activities, and certain managerial actions.

## Lack of reciprocity and social hysteresis

When a manager makes a promise but fails to fulfill it, this creates a lack of reciprocity or a _breach of trust_. Trust is built slowly and can be easily destroyed by actions such as layoffs, or by promising certain work conditions (or a promotion) and not delivering on these promises.

Layoffs in most cases are [not economically justified](https://www.careerusa.org/jobs/179-resources/168-career-files/158-16-must-read-articles/372-lay-off-the-layoffs.html), [negatively affects laid off employees health](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11199253/) (sometimes even [provoke suicide](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0004867414521502)), [negatively affects managers health](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.20102), [significantly decrease performance of remaining employees](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/174038/1/dp11128.pdf). Layoffs are generally perceived as unjust and erode trust in the employer. Such actions exploit the vulnerability of the employee, instilling fear among those who remain.

[Current research on trust and distrust in organizational settings](https://www.jstor.org/stable/259288) identifies fear as one of the primary indicators of the highest degree of distrust:

As soon as one or a few members of the hunting team are expelled for a seemingly trivial reason (which could have been avoided), the team is likely to disintegrate and revert to a mere group.

## Process activities or organisation design peculiarities promoting negative or conflictual social dynamics.

Certain process activities and organisational design peculiarities are well-known for provoking conflict or other types of negative social dynamics within teams.

### PR-based code reviews

As I described in [my article on code reviews](https://qase.io/blog/code-review-alternatives/#social-dynamics), PR-based code reviews can trigger negative social dynamics or even conflict within a team. This is due to the inherent subjectivity of criticism and the difficulty in separating self from work. Imagine someone from outside a hunting team asking its members to recall each interaction and pinpoint mistakes and inefficiencies in each one.

### "Chapters" and "Guilds"

Organizing employees into chapters and guilds based on their specialization might negatively affect teams. Interdependence, trust, and cooperation heavily rely on team bonding. When employees of a certain specialization begin to value their chapter or guild more than the product team they are part of, there's a probability that they will associate themselves more with the chapter or guild than the team. This can lead to a [silo mentality](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/silo-mentality.asp) or even [outgroup prejudice](https://opentextbc.ca/socialpsychology/chapter/ingroup-favoritism-and-prejudice/) within their team.
