This article focus on the negative social dynamics triggered by various aspects of organizational design, process activities, and certain managerial actions.

## Lack of reciprocity

When a manager makes a promise but fails to fulfill it, this creates a lack of reciprocity or a _breach of trust_. Similarly,

Our social behaviour exhibit "tipping points" or "threshold effect": the effect of certain actions may not be visible straight away, but will accumulate, leading to a significant change of system state. Each breach of trust adds to the perception of the decreasing reciprocity until the moment when the team can no longer trust the manager and therefore will deteriorate.

Trust is built slowly and can be easily destroyed by actions such as layoffs, or by promising certain work conditions (or a promotion) and not delivering on these promises.

In a way, trust follows a hysteresis pattern: even if the manager decides to stop lying later on, the accumulated effect of their past dishonesty may persist for an unpredictable period.

Furthermore, it's impossible to quantify the adverse effects of lying or other destructive actions within a team.

Interestingly, in the study of animal behavior in biology, the concept of tipping points is well-explored. These tipping points bear a striking resemblance to the bifurcation points observed in our social systems.

Layoffs in most cases are [not economically justified](https://www.careerusa.org/jobs/179-resources/168-career-files/158-16-must-read-articles/372-lay-off-the-layoffs.html), [negatively affects laid off employees health](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11199253/) (sometimes even [provoke suicide](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0004867414521502)), [negatively affects managers health](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.20102), [significantly decrease performance of remaining employees](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/174038/1/dp11128.pdf). Layoffs are generally perceived as unjust and erode trust in the employer.

The result — the team is likely to deteriorate to a mere group.

The reason for deterioration is simple: as teams are characterised by interdependence and trust, each team member expects others to cooperate and collaborate, and to protect when needed.

As soon as one or a few members of the team are fired for a seemingly trivial reason (which could have been avoided), the collaboration mechanism shutters, and the trust that the team members gained towards each others is gone: a team member can't rely on others to be present even!

Layoffs kills two of three main characteristics of a team: interdependence and trust.

Trust is built with the expectation of reciprocity, and if there's no reciprocity — when those who stay see they themselves didn't protect the person who's fired, they will know that others won't protect them if they are about to be fired. Individualistic fear emerges.

[Current research on trust and distrust in organizational settings](https://www.jstor.org/stable/259288) identifies fear as one of the primary indicators of the highest degree of distrust:

## Process activities or organisation design peculiarities promoting negative or conflictual social dynamics.

Certain process activities and organisational design peculiarities are well-known for provoking conflict or other types of negative social dynamics within teams.

### PR-based code reviews

As I described in [my article on code reviews](https://qase.io/blog/code-review-alternatives/#social-dynamics), PR-based code reviews can trigger negative social dynamics or even conflict within a team.

Every human being associates her work results with themselves, valuing things we spend effort on doing is innate to our nature.

Whenever a developer receives feedback like “this has to be redone”, they will inevitably associate this feedback with themselves: the more effort a person spent on doing something, the more vulnerable they are to the critics. And while they hadn’t been taught properly how the problem should have been solved, they consider negative feedback even worse.

Internet’s full of posts and articles on how to “solve” this “negativity problem”. Most of these posts talk about how to provide more “positive” feedback. Microsoft even [hired a fully dedicated specialist](https://www.michaelagreiler.com/accept-code-review-feedback/?ref=hackernoon.com) working on this issue.

The activity design has a flaw: reviewer is invited to find defects or issues. Consider this scenario: a hunting team comes back from the hunt, and their manager asks them to find defects in each other actions. If a "hunting actions review" is considered successful when the reviewer finds at least some mistakes, the reviewer starts trying to find mistakes. And they will find mistakes, inevitably blaming and being blamed.

Consider the "opposite" scenario when the hunting team sees and corrects the mistakes straight away, right during the hunt. First, correcting the mistake _interactively_ (right when the mistake occurs) reduces the probability of the mistake occurring again. Second, the mistake correction can be (and will be!) achieved in a collaborative manner.

### "Chapters" and "Guilds"

Organizing employees into chapters and guilds based on their specialization might negatively affect teams. Interdependence, trust, and cooperation heavily rely on team bonding. When employees of a certain specialization begin to value their chapter or guild more than the product team they are part of, there's a probability that they will associate themselves more with the chapter or guild than the team. This can lead to a [silo mentality](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/silo-mentality.asp) or even [outgroup prejudice](https://opentextbc.ca/socialpsychology/chapter/ingroup-favoritism-and-prejudice/) within their team.
