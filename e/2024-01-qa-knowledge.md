This is another article in the series on hiring. The [first one](https://qase.io/blog/hiring-quality-cvs/) was about the JDs and CVs, the [second one on designing the interview process](https://sharovatov.github.io/e/2024-01-qa-interview.html).

In the previous article I postulated that the best way to verify the candidate's proficiency in doing a certain job is to actually let them perform that job, observe the process and check the results.

However, some work types demand significant time. Imagine we want to hire a proper QA engineer and one of the types of work we want them to perform is to prepare the risk assessment strategy. Preparing risk assessment strategy involves many steps, each of them is quite significant. Even understanding the project scope and objectives along with identifying potential risks would likely take days if not weeks.

Increasing interview time to a week will considerably decrease the attractiveness of the position. Candidates rarely choose companies with extremely lengthy interviews.

This leads to choosing between two options:
1. invest in improving the EVP so that candidates will still desire to pass lengthy interviews
2. decreasing the quality and extensiveness of the verification process

Improving the EVP always sounds like a good plan, but not all companies allow EMs to influence the budgeting unfortunately.

This leaves us with the option 2: decreasing the quality and extensiveness of the verification process.

If the interview is short, it will not deter candidates, but if it's not possible to fully perform the jobs we need to verify during the short interview, the interview design should change.

In QC, we design smoke test plan to cover just the most critical verification scenarios. Similarly to our case, smoke testing doesn't provide extensive verification coverage, but can be performed faster than the detailed test plan.

лучшая проверка — деятельности проверка
но иногда она может заниматьс too much time
да и не все покрывает

мы можем сознательно ухудшать качество проверки для сокращения времени
редуцируя сложную деятельность до простых действий, необходимых но недостаточных
