    <h1>Apple submitted HTTP Live Streaming spec to IETF</h1>
<div><p>As <a href="http://sharovatov.wordpress.com/2009/04/28/silverlight-smooth-streaming-and-http/">I’ve blogged recently</a>, nearly a year ago Microsoft proposed an approach for adaptive video streaming over HTTP – Smooth Streaming. As Microsoft didn’t apply for a patent for this technology, I was hoping to see the same beautiful approach implemented in modules for other web-servers, or even as web-applications – as it’s really easy to implement.</p>
<p>The mistake Microsoft did was that they didn’t submit this technology standard to IETF to make it RFC – and that’s what Apple’s doing at the moment.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m not mistaken – Apple copied the whole idea, called it <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-00.txt">HTTP Live Streaming and submitted to IETF</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, there’re differences, but they are absolutely insignificant:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Apple spec suggests extending M3U format for a playlist – Microsoft uses <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL20/">SMIL-compliant</a> ISMC client-manifest file (i.e. playlist)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apple spec defines that the server creates the playlist – in Microsoft approach the encoder creates the playlist</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apple spec defines encryption for media files – Microsoft doesn’t</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And the whole specification that’s been proposed is weird – I think they just wanted to submit it as soon as possible before Microsoft Smooth Streaming approach gets popularity and becomes de-facto standard.</p>
<p>Here’s what jumped at me when I was reading the spec:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>section 6.2.3. Reloading the Playlist file - why specify the expiration time of the playlist separately when HTTP 1.1 already has flexible methods for <br>setting expiration time of the resource?</p>
</li>
<li><p>encryption - what’s the purpose of encrypting media files when there’s HTTPS? And if there’s a purpose - HTTP already provides a place where encryption could be &quot;plugged in&quot; - Transfer-Encoding, why didn&#39;t Apple just register another transfer-coding in IANA?</p>
</li>
<li><p>EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE - why add this if HTTP already gives flexible tools to control caching?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So as I see it – Apple was just a little bit in a hurry to propose this “standard” – looks like they took Microsoft idea, added some proprietary bits and bobs without thinking them through, didn’t use what HTTP natively provides but bravely called the draft “<strong>HTTP</strong> Live Streaming”.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
