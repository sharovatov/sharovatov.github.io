    <h1>small piece of js code explained</h1>
<div><p>Today a colleague showed me a piece of js code and asked to explain how it works.</p>
<p>Here’s the code:</p>
<pre><code>(function(x) {return x(x);})(function(z){ return function(y){ return z; } })(1)(2)(3) 
</code></pre><p>For many from non-js background it would be easier if I rewrite first two function expressions as function declarations, turn third function expression into named function expression and break the execution into parts:</p>
<pre><code>function f1(x) {
    return x(x);
}
function f2(z) {
    return function f3 (y) {
        return z;
    }
}
var result1 = f1(f2);
var result2 = result1(1);
var result3 = result2(2);
var result4 = result3(3);
</code></pre><p>So let&#39;s see what each function does first:</p>
<p>Function <strong>f1</strong> accepts one argument and calls this argument as a function and passes it with itself as a parameter.</p>
<p>Function <strong>f2 </strong>accepts parameter <strong>z </strong>and creates another function. As <strong>f2 </strong>scope gets copied to <strong>f3</strong>, argument <strong>z </strong>is always accessible from within <strong>f3</strong>; and what <strong>f3</strong> does is it returns this argument <strong>z</strong>.</p>
<p>After we grasp the idea of what these functions do, let’s see how everything is executed.</p>
<p>When <code>var result1 = f1(f2)</code> is executed, <strong>f1</strong> is called with <strong>f2</strong> passed as a parameter. <code>return x(x)</code> means that we need to call <code>f2(f2)</code> and return the result.</p>
<p>When <strong>f2</strong> is called with <strong>f2</strong> as a parameter, function <strong>f3</strong> will be created and it’s <strong>z</strong> will hold a reference to <strong>f2</strong>. And this <strong>f3</strong> is returned to <strong>result1</strong>.</p>
<p>Now we know that <strong>result1 </strong>actually holds a reference to <strong>f3</strong> which regardless of the parameters always returns a reference to <strong>f2</strong> which it “remembered” earlier. Hence, when we come to execute <code>var result2 = result1(1)</code>, we actually call <strong>f3(1)</strong> and our <strong>f3</strong> just returns a reference to <strong>f2</strong>.</p>
<p>So, this part of the code </p>
<pre><code>(function(x) { return x(x) })(function(z){ return function(y) { return z; } })(1)
</code></pre><p>could be replaced with </p>
<pre><code>(function(z){ return function(y) { return z; } })
</code></pre><p>Let&#39;s move on and execute <code>var result3 = result2(2);</code>. We’ve just found out that <strong>result2</strong> holds a reference to <strong>f2</strong>, so it’s rather <strong>f2(2)</strong> that we’re seeing here, which – as we remember – creates <strong>f3</strong> function and stores <strong>z</strong> in it’s context. This <strong>f3</strong> will always return 2, <strong>result3</strong> is a function will always return 2.</p>
<p>And when we execute <code>var result4 = result3(3)</code>,<strong> f3(3)</strong> is actually called and returns 2 as expected.</p>
<p>I think, this again proves that javascript is syntactically very powerful language.</p>
